# Welcome to My Knowledge Cathedral

This is a **living knowledge repository** where thoughts evolve from seeds 🌱 to forests 🌲, connections emerge organically, and knowledge compounds over time.

## Core Principles

### Everything is a Node
Each piece of knowledge exists as a node in the graph. Nodes can be:
- **Seeds** 🌱 - Quick captures, rough ideas
- **Saplings** 🌿 - Developing thoughts with some structure  
- **Trees** 🌳 - Mature, well-developed concepts
- **Forests** 🌲 - Interconnected systems of thought

### Bidirectional Linking
When you create a [[link to another node]], that node automatically knows about it. This creates a web of [[backlinks]] that helps discover unexpected connections.

### Version Control
Every edit is tracked in Git, creating a complete history of how ideas evolve.

## Start Exploring

- Visit [[/now]] to see current areas of focus
- Check out [[/evergreen]] for mature, timeless content
- Explore the [[/graph]] to see everything connected

*Happy exploring!* 🏛️
